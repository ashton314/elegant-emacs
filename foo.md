# Writer Entry

This is totally a mode for writers.

Text styles: *italic* **bold** ~~strikeout~~

Then of course you'll want a blockquote:

> This is a block quote with some fancy-looking text.

This setup will autosave files after a certain number of idle seconds and will also automatically revert the buffer if it's modified by an external program. Lines auto-wrap in markdown, text, and org modes. (Programming modes are not affected.)

Of course, footnotes are obligatory.[^1]

```
Here's a fenced code-block, though I don't think Sarah will be using that much.
```

## Second-level heading

Headings are pretty discrete. I might change that in the future.

[^1]: Here's a footnote!
